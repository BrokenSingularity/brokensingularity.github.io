		<p><span class="highlightText">Nuclear Frost</span>. The main goal of the game is to plunge the player into the atmosphere of a frozen world and the struggle of people for their existence, as well as to show how dangerous the use of nuclear weapons and the neglect of climate problems can be.</p>
		<p>The world in the game has been in a state of nuclear winter for many years due to the impact of nuclear weapons on the Earth's atmosphere, so a person destroyed his home.</p>
		<p>Over the years, organisms on the surface began to mutate under the influence of radiation, and this is how the Ice Orusfair mushroom was born, which became the number one threat to humans. It spreads incredibly fast, and affects all living organisms in different ways. It is characterized by the fact that, having been in some creature, it remembers its DNA, and transfers it in disputes to another carrier. From what appear bleeding trees with flesh, dogs with human hands, and so on. In the human body, the development of this fungus is divided into several stages:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The temperature drops to 34 degrees</li>
			<li>Madness, dementia, anger and obsession are coming. The miners do not come out of the mines, greedily digging the earth deeper and deeper. The military starts fighting for no apparent reason.</li>
			<li>Stasis. A person turns into a "Vegetable", cannot eat, drink, sleep - he just lies, and that's it. At this stage, there is a mutation at the DNA level</li>
			<li>At the last stage, a person finally mutates into some kind of creature and becomes a carrier of this disease.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Our hero did not find the war itself, he was born already in the bunker and only from the stories he knew what world was "Before". All the time, his house was under the threat of extinction due to the epidemic of Ice Orusfaira, each time the foci of infection were eliminated, but not this time. The situation escalated to such an extent that almost the majority of the population of the bunker was infected with the fungus, including the hero. The moment has come to act decisively, so the hero is tasked with saving his home at any cost, even if he has to give his life for it.</p>
